Our book synthesizes new understandings of multimodal political networks: 
what they are, how to measure and analyze them, 
and what they can reveal about political structures and actions.

A primary purpose of this book is to draw the attention of political theorists and researchers 
to new theoretical, methodological, and substantive tools for extending political network research 
into new realms and revitalizing established domains.
