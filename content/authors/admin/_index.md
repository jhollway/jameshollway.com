How can we institutionalise effective, resilient, and adaptable international cooperation?
Which institutions are more effective than others?
Which designs work best in different domains, over the short term and the long term?
How can we promote meaningful participation?
And how does the structure of complex networks of institutions affect these and other outcomes?

In my research, I develop multilevel and dynamic theories, methods, and data 
to help us better understand the implications of institutional and policy choices
in various empirical settings such as fisheries, freshwater, and trade.

<!-- I am Principle Investigator of the PANARCHIC project
