# Very, very short introduction to R ####

# Pre-note: ####
# This is not a course to learn R. This is just a very, very brief introduction
# so that you have a basic introduction as we move forward.
# If you would like to develop your skills further (not such a bad idea)
# there are lots of excellent online courses and resources available.
# Recommended elsewhere are the following:

#
# These sites will help you learn or refresh your memory.
# But you can also expect to return to Google often as you go and type "R ..." as a query.
# That's fine, and totally normal.
# You will find as you do so that answers to most questions are available
# on fora pages such as StackOverflow and CrossValidated.

# What is R? ####
# From the project web-site http://www.r-project.org/:
#       R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. 
#       R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, 
#       classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, ...) 
#       and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. 
#       R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's 
#       GNU General Public License in source code form.
#
# This means that anybody can write extensions to R and make them publically 
# available, e.g. sna, igraph, statnet, RSiena, netsim, goldfish...

# The R environment (Console + Script) and getting help! ####
#
# Let's take a look around RStudio.
# There should be 4 panes open in the window.
# There should be a console: this is where RStudio runs the commands you send it in R.
# By default, the console is beneath the window where you are reading this.

# You can write these commands into the console directly, but we usually write code
# in an R script, like this one above the console, and then run it.
# There are basically three reasons for using a script: editing, repetition, sharing.

# You can run a command in RStudio by moving the cursor to the line you want to run
# and then press Cmd-Enter (Mac) or Ctrl-Enter (Windows, also Mac?).
# You can try this with the following lines:
1+5 # This will print the result
105*99+6 # An asterisk is used for multiplication
# Note that R won't execute anything after a comment (#)
# If you try to run a commented out line, it will continue until it finds the next command.
# 1/5 # Remove the hash symbol at the start of this line to run it.
# You can remove the hash symbol manually or toggle it on/off using Cmd-Shift-C/Ctrl-Shift-C.

# Ok, wow, R is a calculator! But it is also much, much more than that.
# Try the following command
print("Hello World")
# You've told R to print a string of text (identified by the quotation marks) to the console.
# Much more flexible than a high school calculator!

# Note that R is case-sensitive, 
# i.e. Print("Hello World") does not work (Capital P). Try it!
# So Hollway is not the same as james or JAMES (and not the same as Holloway...). 
# In R, we can write such logical statements as:
"James"=="james" # Try also "James"!="james"

# Why do we have to use two equals signs and quotation marks?
# Quotation marks tells R you are referring to a string of text and not a named object.
# An object is a placeholder R uses for one or more numbers, strings, or other things.
# You can assign such things to an object using one = sign, 
# but it's better to use <- to avoid mistakes
surname <- "Hollway"
y.chromosome <- T # or TRUE
siblings <- 1
age <- NA # This is used for missing information
# Note that these objects then appear in the environment pane on the top right

# You can then recover this information by simply calling these objects:
surname
y.chromosome
siblings
age
# And even operate on them
siblings*3
# Try multiplying the other objects by 3

# We can also concatenate multiple values together using the function c():
lived <- c("New Zealand","UK","New Zealand","Germany","UK","Switzerland")
# And recall them. Where was the fourth place I lived?
# Square brackets [ ] are used for indexing
lived[4]
# There are several shortcuts for making a series of values.
# For example, consecutive numbers can be produced with:
teenageyrs <- 13:19
teenageqrtrs <- seq(13, 19, by=0.25)
# We can recall every third value from this object using a repeating vector 
teenageqrtrs[c(FALSE,FALSE,TRUE)]
# While the following also works, it is best practice to write out the logic:
# teenageqrtrs[c(F,F,T)]

# Data can be aggregated in R into different formats, such as data frames and lists
# but the most common one used for network research is the matrix format.
# Matrices are created by populating a given number of rows and columns with data
# Assigning, "<-", doesn't print any output unless you wrap the line in parentheses
(my.matrix <- matrix(data=1:9, nrow=6, ncol=6))
# If you look in the help file, 
# which you can access by putting a ? before the command/function name,
# you will see matrix sets byrow=F by default.
?matrix # Forgot the exact name of the function? Use ?? for search...
# This means that it populates the matrix with the data by column by default,
# but we can populate it by row instead by adding an extra 'argument': 
(my.2nd.matrix <- matrix(1:9, 6, 6, byrow = T))

# We can index cells of a matrix using square brackets with a comma [ , ]
my.2nd.matrix[2,2] 
# Left of the comma is the row, right of the comma is the column
# We can even overwrite particular cells of the matrix by assigning a new value
(my.2nd.matrix[my.2nd.matrix==6] <- 600)

# Data frames are like matrices, but can hold different types of variables at once.
# For example, we can begin a data frame of 
# TASK: Replace the missing data (the NAs) with your details
mydf <- data.frame(Surname = c("Hollway", NA),
                   Born = c("New Zealand", NA),
                   Siblings = c(1, NA))
# Base R has (at least) one annoying "feature" though...
# it considers text variables ("strings") as something called "factors".
# You can see this in the (top right) "Environment" pane, 
# if you show the details of the mydf object.
# Sometimes this can be useful, even required, 
# but usually you just want "character" strings.
# To make sure strings are parsed correctly, you'll need to add an extra argument.
mydf <- data.frame(Surname = c("Hollway", NA),
                   Born = c("New Zealand", NA),
                   Siblings = c(1, NA),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# You can even add new variables by simply writing a new variable name:
mydf$Dept <- c("IRPS", NA)
# TASK: Can you call the data frame and print to the console?

# We can recall an observation (row) or variable (column) of the data frame
# in the same way that we indexed the matrix above, e.g. mydf[2,2]
# but we can also call a named variable using the $ sign.
mydf$Surname
# This can be very handy when "subsetting" the data:
james <- mydf[ mydf$Surname=="Hollway", ]

# Note, however, that data frames must have variables of equal length.
# Lists are a more flexible generalisation of data frames.
mylist <- list() # Here we are initialising an empty list
# List items can also be named, like data frame variables, but don't have to be:
mylist$Surname <- c("Hollway", NA)
mylist$Siblings <- c(1, NA) # Now you can add the others from above
# You can also add lists to a list:
mylist$Lived <- list(c("New Zealand","UK","New Zealand","Germany","UK","Switzerland"),
                     NA)

# Parentheses () are usually used for functions
exp(0.09855)
mean(c(1, 5, 8, 7, 6, 4, 22, 1, 0.9))
# Indeed, every function must be followed by (), even if empty
ls() # This tells you what objects are in your environment
getwd() # This tells you the directory on your computer R is working in/on
list.files() # This tells you what files are in your working directory 
setwd("...") # You can set the working directory with this function 
# (or under session in RStudio)
# Finally, functions such as the following allow you to write an object out of R 
# to somewhere on your harddrive that you specify:
write.csv(mydf, file = "~/Desktop/jamesdf.csv")

# Tasks ####
# 1. Create and fill in a matrix of "whom you already know" in the class:
# There are other ways to do this, 
# but for this unit test I'd like you to do it in R.
# You can follow my example below (copy to a new script and uncomment):

# mynetwork <- matrix(0,2,2) # this creates an empty network of 2 people
# Next I'm going to name the matrix rows and columns:
# rownames(mynetwork) <- c("James Hollway","Idil Yildiz")
# colnames(mynetwork) <- c("James Hollway","Idil Yildiz")
# mynetwork[1,2] <- 1 # this means I know Andrea already
# mynetwork[2,1] <- 1 # I think I can say Andrea knows me already too...
# mynetwork["James Hollway","Idil Yildiz"] <- 1 # I could also do this by name
### mynetwork[mynetwork > 0] <- 0 # Just in case you make a mistake, this wipes it!

# 2. Upload your R script in which you created this matrix to Moodle
